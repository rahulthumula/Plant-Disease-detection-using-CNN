# Plant Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
## Introduction
Plant diseases are one of the major challenges faced by farmers worldwide, leading to significant economic losses and food insecurity. Early detection and diagnosis of plant diseases are critical to prevent their spread and minimize crop damage. In recent years, machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have shown great promise in plant disease detection using image analysis. This project aims to develop a deep learning-based approach for accurate and efficient detection of plant diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes images of healthy and diseased plants from various sources, including the PlantVillage dataset. The dataset contains multiple classes of diseases affecting different plant species, such as tomatoes, apples, and grapes. To improve training efficiency and convergence of the model, the images are preprocessed by resizing them to a fixed size and normalizing the pixel values.

## CNN Architecture
The CNN architecture used in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, max pooling layers, batch normalization layers, and fully connected layers with softmax activation. The model is trained using the Keras API for TensorFlow and data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, and shifts to increase the diversity of the training set and reduce overfitting.

## Performance Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated on a separate validation set and test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, indicating its potential for practical use in plant disease diagnosis. In addition, the model's confusion matrix is analyzed to determine the classification performance of each disease class.

## Deployment
The trained model can be deployed on various platforms, such as cloud servers, edge devices, or mobile applications, to provide a convenient and accessible solution for plant disease diagnosis. In this project, a mobile app is developed for on-the-go detection, allowing farmers and plant pathologists to capture images of plant leaves and receive real-time disease diagnosis.

## Conclusion
This project provides a sustainable and cost-effective solution for early detection of plant diseases, helping farmers and plant pathologists make informed decisions about crop protection. By reducing the use of harmful pesticides, this project contributes to sustainable farming practices and promotes food security. The project can be extended to other plant species and diseases, and the CNN architecture can be optimized further for better performance.
